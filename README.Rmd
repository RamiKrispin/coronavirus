The coronavirus package provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic and the vaccination efforts by country. The raw data is being pulled from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus [repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 

More details available [here](https://RamiKrispin.github.io/coronavirus/), and a `csv` format of the package dataset available [here](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/tree/master/csv)

## Important Notes

* As this an ongoing situation, frequent changes in the data format may occur, please visit the package [changelog](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus/news/index.html) (e.g., News) and/or see pinned [issues](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/issues) to get updates about those changes
* As of Auguest 4th JHU CCSE stopped track recovery cases, please see this [issue](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/issues/71) for more details
* Negative values and/or anomalies may occurred in the data for the following reasons:
    * The calculation of the daily cases from the raw data which is in cumulative format is done by taking the daily difference. In some cases, some retro updates not tie to the day that they actually occurred such as removing false positive cases
    * Anomalies or error in the raw data
    * Please see this [issue](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/issues/55) for more details

## Installation
Install the CRAN version:

```r
install.packages("coronavirus")
```

Install the Github version (refreshed on a daily bases):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/coronavirus")
```

## Datasets

The package provides the following two datasets:

* **coronavirus** - tidy (long) format of the JHU CCSE [datasets](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series). That includes the following columns:
    * `date` - The date of the observation, using `Date` class
    * `province` - Name of province/state, for countries where data is provided split across multiple provinces/states
    * `country` - Name of country/region
    * `lat` - The latitude code
    * `long` - The longitude code 
    * `type` - An indicator for the type of cases (confirmed, death, recovered)
    * `cases` - Number of cases on given date
    * `uid` - Country code
    * `province_state` - Province or state if applicable
    * `iso2` - Officially assigned country code identifiers with two-letter
    * `iso3` - Officially assigned country code identifiers with three-letter
    * `code3` - UN country code
    * `fips` - Federal Information Processing Standards code that uniquely identifies counties within the USA
    *   `combined_key` - Country and province (if applicable)
    *   `population` - Country or province population
    *   `continent_name` - Continent name
    *   `continent_code` - Continent code
* **covid19_vaccine** - a tidy (long) format of the the Johns Hopkins [Centers for Civic Impact](https://civicimpact.jhu.edu/) global vaccination [dataset](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables/vaccine_data) by country. This dataset includes the following columns:

    *   `country_region` - Country or region name
    *   `date` - Data collection date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    *   `doses_admin` - Cumulative number of doses administered. When a vaccine requires multiple doses, each one is counted independently
    *  `people_partially_vaccinated` - Cumulative number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. When the person receives a prescribed second dose, it is not counted twice
    *   `people_fully_vaccinated` - Cumulative number of people who received all prescribed doses necessary to be considered fully vaccinated
    *   `report_date_string` - Data report date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    *   `uid` - Country code
    *   `province_state` - Province or state if applicable
    *   `iso2` - Officially assigned country code identifiers with two-letter
    *   `iso3` - Officially assigned country code identifiers with three-letter
    *   `code3` - UN country code
    *   `fips` - Federal Information Processing Standards code that uniquely identifies counties within the USA
    *   `lat` - Latitude
    *   `long` - Longitude
    *   `combined_key` - Country and province (if applicable)
    *   `population` - Country or province population
    *   `continent_name` - Continent name
    *   `continent_code` - Continent code

## Data refresh

While the **coronavirus** [CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/package=coronavirus) is updated every month or two, the [Github (Dev) version](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) is updated on a daily bases. The `update_dataset` function enables to overcome this gap and keep the installed version with the most recent data available on the Github version:

``` r
library(coronavirus)
update_dataset()
```

**Note:** must restart the R session to have the updates available

Alternatively, you can pull the data using the [Covid19R](https://covid19r.github.io/documentation/) project [data standard format](https://covid19r.github.io/documentation/data-format-standard.html) with the `refresh_coronavirus_jhu` function:

```{r}
covid19_df <- refresh_coronavirus_jhu()
head(covid19_df)
```



## Usage


```{r}
data("coronavirus")

head(coronavirus)
```


Summary of the total confrimed cases by country (top 20):

```{r}
library(dplyr)

summary_df <- coronavirus %>% 
  filter(type == "confirmed") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(-total_cases)

summary_df %>% head(20) 
```


Summary of new cases during the past 24 hours by country and type (as of `r max(coronavirus$date)`):

```{r}
library(tidyr)

coronavirus %>% 
  filter(date == max(date)) %>%
  select(country, type, cases) %>%
  group_by(country, type) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type,
              values_from = total_cases) %>%
  arrange(-confirmed)
  
```


Plotting daily confirmed and death cases in Brazil:

``` r
library(plotly)

coronavirus %>% 
  group_by(type, date) %>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = total_cases) %>%
