<p>The <code>covid19_vaccine</code> dataset provides time-series data on the vaccination progress by country or province (if applicable). Likewise the <code>coronavirus</code> dataset, the COVID19 vaccine raw data is collected by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE). The <code>covid19_vaccine</code> data includes the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>country_region</code> - Country or region name</li>
<li>
<code>date</code> - Data collection date in YYYY-MM-DD format</li>
<li>
<code>doses_admin</code> - Cumulative number of doses administered. When a vaccine requires multiple doses, each one is counted independently</li>
<li>
<code>people_partially_vaccinated</code> - Cumulative number of people who received at least one vaccine dose. When the person receives a prescribed second dose, it is not counted twice</li>
<li>
<code>people_fully_vaccinated</code> - Cumulative number of people who received all prescribed doses necessary to be considered fully vaccinated</li>
<li>
<code>report_date_string</code> - Data report date in YYYY-MM-DD format</li>
<li>
<code>uid</code> - Country code</li>
<li>
<code>province_state</code> - Province or state if applicable</li>
<li>
<code>iso2</code> - Officially assigned country code identifiers with two-letter</li>
<li>
<code>iso3</code> - Officially assigned country code identifiers with three-letter</li>
<li>
<code>code3</code> - UN country code</li>
<li>
<code>fips</code> - Federal Information Processing Standards code that uniquely identifies counties within the USA</li>
<li>
<code>lat</code> - Latitude</li>
<li>
<code>long</code> - Longitude</li>
<li>
<code>combined_key</code> - Country and province (if applicable)</li>
<li>
<code>population</code> - Country or province population</li>
<li>
<code>continent_name</code> - Continent name</li>
<li>
<code>continent_code</code> - Continent code</li>
</ul>

<p>We can measure the proportion of the vaccinated group out of the total population using the <code>people_fully_vaccinated</code> and <code>population</code> fields. We will start by filtering the data by the latest date and removing observations without population data (province-level):</p>

</h3>
<p>We can compare the changes in the daily new cases and the cumulative number of fully vaccinated on the country level by merging the <code>coronavirus</code> and <code>covid19_vaccine</code> datasets.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> At this point, the <code>coronavirus</code> dataset does not have the <code>ios</code> country codes. Therefore, a merge between the two datasets may require some manual effort for adjusting the country codes.</p>
<p>In the following example, we will plot the daily number of cases and the total number of fully vaccinated people in the US. We will filter the datasets by country and merge them by date:</p>
