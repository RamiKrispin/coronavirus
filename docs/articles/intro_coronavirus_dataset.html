<p>The <code>coronavirus</code> dataset provides a daily summary of COVID-19 cases by geographic location (i.e., country/province). It includes total daily confirmed, death, and recovery<sup>1</sup> cases. Let’s load the dataset from the <strong>coronavirus</strong> package:</p>

<p>The dataset has the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>date</code> - The date of the summary</li>
<li>
<code>province</code> - The province or state, when applicable</li>
<li>
<code>country</code> - The country or region name</li>
<li>
<code>Lat</code> - Latitude point</li>
<li>
<code>Long</code> - Longitude point</li>
<li>
<code>type</code> - the type of case (i.e., confirmed, death)</li>
<li>
<code>cases</code> - the number of daily cases (corresponding to the case type)</li>
<li>
<code>uid</code> - Country code</li>
<li>
<code>iso2</code> - Officially assigned country code identifiers with two-letter</li>
<li>
<code>iso3</code> - Officially assigned country code identifiers with there-letter</li>
<li>
<code>code3</code> - UN country code</li>
<li>
<code>combined_key</code> - Country and province (if applicable)</li>
<li>
<code>population</code> - Country or province population</li>
<li>
<code>continent_name</code> - Continent name</li>
<li>
